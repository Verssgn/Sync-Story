# SYNC STORY
[Success story](https://github.com/Lacro59/playnite-successstory-plugin) is a plugin for playnite that allows you to use achievements.
This is a simple script that fetches achievement data from the Goldberg Emu folder in %appdata% and puts it in the Success Story files.

Check the [Wiki](https://github.com/Verssgn/Sync-Story/wiki/Setup) for setup tutorial

> [!CAUTION]
> **For now the achievements will only update after you restart playnite.**

> _The restart feature in config is scuffed right now, so you shoudnt use it also..._
